# Stakeholder Interview Summary

**Date**: November 23, 2024  
**Interviewer**: Development Team Lead  
**Stakeholder**: student (CEO & Founder, FreshCut Solutions)

## Business Vision

**What we do**: We provide premium pre-processed fruits and vegetables in vacuum packaging for professional kitchens. Our clients are pastry shops, ice cream makers, and food manufacturers who need fresh, ready-to-use ingredients.

**Why we're different**: 

- All products are processed within 6 hours from harvest
- Vacuum technology keeps products fresh for 14 days
- We work directly with certified farms in Northern Italy
- Custom cuts and preparations based on client needs

**Target market**: 

- Primary: Pastry shops and gelaterias (60% of business)
- Secondary: Hotels and restaurants (25%)
- Growing: Food manufacturers (15%)

## Key Requirements (Business Perspective)

### 1. Product Catalog

- Start with 80 products (40 fruits, 30 vegetables, 10 special preparations)
- Each product needs multiple size options (1kg, 5kg, 10kg packages)
- Seasonal availability calendar is CRITICAL
- Product specs sheets downloadable as PDF

### 2. B2B Features

- Minimum order: €500
- Credit line management (30-60 days payment terms)
- Bulk pricing based on volume
- Recurring orders feature

### 3. Geographic Coverage

- **Initial wish**: 3 warehouses (Milan, Rome, Berlin) for all Europe coverage
- **Reality check after discussion**: Start with Milan, expand later
- Delivery within 48 hours in Italy
- 72 hours for neighboring countries

### 4. Technology Dreams vs Reality

**Original request (Saturday morning)**:
"We need blockchain for supply chain tracking! Every apple should be traceable from tree to kitchen. Our competitors don't have this!"

**After technical discussion (Saturday afternoon)**:
"OK, I understand. After Walmart and Carrefour spent millions on blockchain with little ROI, maybe we start simple. QR codes and batch tracking are enough for now."

### 5. Integration Needs

- Must integrate with client's ERP systems (SAP, Oracle)
- API for automated ordering
- Export data as CSV for smaller clients
- EDI support for large manufacturers

## Business Constraints

### Budget

- Development: €40,000 (negotiated from initial €35,000)
- Monthly operations: €3,000 
- Marketing: Separate budget

### Timeline

- MVP: 3 months
- Full launch: 6 months
- Must be ready before summer season (peak for fruit business)

### Competition

- Current competitors use old platforms (no API, no mobile)
- We need to be tech-forward but not bleeding edge
- Security is paramount (we work with food industry giants)

## Points of Discussion

### Blockchain Discussion (Saturday 14:00)

**Stakeholder**: "Blockchain will revolutionize our supply chain!"
**Developer feedback**: "IBM Food Trust shut down in 2023. Walmart's blockchain traced only 1% of products after 5 years. Cost was $100k+/year just for infrastructure."
**Final decision**: "Let's use traditional batch tracking with QR codes. Same transparency, 5% of the cost."

### Multi-warehouse Strategy (Saturday 16:00)

**Initial request**: "We need 3 warehouses from day one"
**Developer concern**: "Each warehouse needs inventory sync, staff training, local regulations compliance"
**Compromise**: "Start with Milan hub + partnership with local couriers for same-day delivery in Rome/Berlin"

### AI Implementation (Sunday 10:00)

**Stakeholder wish**: "AI should predict what each client needs!"
**Technical reality**: "We need 12 months of data for meaningful predictions"
**Agreement**: "Launch with simple seasonal suggestions, add ML after collecting data"

## Success Metrics

- 200 active B2B accounts in first year
- €3M revenue target year 1
- 95% on-time delivery rate
- Less than 2% product waste

## Notes from Follow-up (Sunday afternoon)

After sleeping on it, I realize the developer is right about starting simple. We can always add complexity later. What matters is:

1. Rock-solid security (our clients trust us with their payment terms)
2. Reliable delivery tracking
3. Easy ordering process
4. Real-time inventory

The blockchain and AI can wait for version 2.0.
